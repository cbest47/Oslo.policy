1.Implementation of Oslo.policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Risk: none

Impact: Implementing Oslo.policy helps to consolidate policy from the many different OpenStack services.

Likelihood: already implemented in OpenStack

Impact: Medium

Overall Risk Rating: low

Recommendation: implement, improve

Investigation result: This is a good thing because it increases the visibility into what policies are currently
in effect. A more effective measure would be to implement more in depth role based access control.
